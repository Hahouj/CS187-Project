      <h1> What I learned from this course. </h1>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"> As I reflect on what I have learned in this class and what I will take with me when the class is over, I realize that the final grade was no longer the objective that I was striving so hard for. What really matters is what I have learned while on this particular journey. Recently, I took some time alone to think of this course and to reflect on how it changed my identity as a college student. When I first started this course I looked at it differently compared to how I look at it now. But after learning all these new ideas I’ve expanded my knowledge and now I feel like I have a good understanding on what html, css, and other ideas are like that was brought up in CS187. I May glance at machineces and see how they were constructed and reflect on how ideas in CS187 affects us on a day to day basis and in our future. As well sometimes experience ideas from CS187 with us not even realizing it. So now when I step outside into the outdoors I now look into the world in a different view. In the beginning of the semester when I started this class, my major goal was to get a good grade as well as to improve as a CS major, but perhaps what I have come to realize is that the grade is not as important as the discovery of who I am as a person- and that has made all the difference. </p>

    <h1>Get to know me!</h1>
    <p>Hi my name is Hassan Houjazy and this is one of the very first projects I created in CS187.  </p>
    <h style="font-size:100%; ">
    <p>I love to play sports, workout, learn, play games, and lastly crafting ideas and things. My favorite sports are soccer and track. For soccer I used to play for the highschool as mainly a striker but there are also times where I played as a winger. I also ran track as a middle distance runner and It was enjoyable. Running track takes time and effort to learn. There are techniques when it comes down to running whether it be a realy or in an individual race. My favorite genre of games are mainly FPS, Indie, and multiplayer. I also make items out of wood for example I like making chairs and other sorts of conventional items.
